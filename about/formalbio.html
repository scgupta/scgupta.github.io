<p>
At present, I am enjoying sabbatical :-)
</p>

<p>
I worked at Amazon, where I developed data models and backend services for customer registration and onboarding 
in <a href="https://www.amazonbusiness.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AmazonBusiness.in</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before that, I was a Senior Software Engineer in 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/adg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Advanced Development Group</a> at 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/india" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft Research India</a>,
where I helped transforming cool exciting technologies invented at Microsoft Research into Microsoft products and services.
I worked on <a href="/projects/mobile-app-energy-profiler.html">mobile application energy profiler</a> (released as 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/10/30/introducing-windows-phone-sdk-8-0.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">battery profiler</a> 
in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35471" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Phone SDK 8.0</a> 
in Oct 2012, and later an improved version in Visual Studio 2013 for Windows 8), and indoor localization.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining Microsoft Research, I worked at IBM Rational Software as programmer and tech lead developing various 
programming tools: modern Modeling IDE capabilities for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Executable Models</a> with 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UML Action Language</a> in

for its Real Time edition, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/06/0822_satish-giridhar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PurifyPlus</a> 
for AIX, and a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/0816_GuptaPalanki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Java memory leak</a> 
detection tool called <a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research.nsf/pages/r.plansoft.innovation2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakbot</a>.
</p>

<p>
My computer science interests include program analysis &amp; profiling tools, compilers, 
software development environments, software engineering tools, programming languages and type theory.
Of late, I have been curious about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, I love computer science, and building software systems and programming tools; 
<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">I still program</a>, and 
I unabashedly confess that I am <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just a programmer</a>.
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the industrial town of Kanpur (India) at the bank of river 
<a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/~amit/other/ganges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ganga</a>. 
I received my B.Tech. in <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chemical Engineering</a> (with minor 
in Computing) from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a> in 1996, 
and a Masters in <a href="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Computer Science</a> from 
<a href="http://www.uwm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee</a> in 2001.
</p>

<p>
I find solace in <a href="/projects/">computer programming</a>, 
bliss in <a href="/hindi/">Hindi poetry</a>, 
solitude at <a href="/trekking/">high altitudes in Himalayas</a>, and 
humor in <a href="http://www.finlosophy.com" target="_blank">personal finance</a> choices.
