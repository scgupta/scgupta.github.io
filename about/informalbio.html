<p>
Satish Chandra Gupta&#39;s favorite pastime is teaching <strong>Polymorphism 
for Practitioners</strong> course and he has successfully used the 
accompanying class diagram as a classical example. He grew up in the 
industrial town of Kanpur at the bank of river 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ganga</a>. 
Apart from earning many nicknames (including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_%28mythology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyperion</a>, 
after one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_%28moon%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saturn's moon</a>, 
by his <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/r/rpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PurifyPlus</a> mates), 
he has also earned a B.Tech. in 
<a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chemical Engineering</a> 
from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a> 
in 1996, and a Masters in <a href="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Computer Science</a> 
(or master of disguise?) from 
<a href="http://www.uwm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee</a> in 2001.
</p>

<p>
Quite long ago, he used to pretend to do research and managed to 
<a href="/about/publications.html">publish</a> some of his work in ACM/IEEE conferences. 
His friends think that he wants to be a 
<a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PhD</a> or a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warren Buffett</a>, 
but he secretly nurtures his fantasy to be a <a href="/hindi/">Hindi poet</a> and novelist. 
At the moment though, he has settled for making his living by being 
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just a programmer</a>, 
most recently at Amazon, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/adg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft Research</a>, and IBM Rational Software, where he 
<a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still wrote programs</a>, 
dreaming all the while to write a novel one day. 
Till that day, he has resigned to his fate of getting his fix by 
<a href="/trekking/" target="_blank">trekking at high altitude in Himalaya</a> 
and being <a href="http://www.finlosophy.com" target="_blank">finlosopher</a>. 
At present, he is enjoying sabbatical.  

<p>
<strong>Quiz for the day:</strong> Which Face is the latest? Implement an O(n) draw() method for that face.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Open Problem:</strong> How will he look when you meet him next? 
Hint: all concrete Faces existed with-in one year of each other, 
so it is a kind of trick question.
