<p>
Rational <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/r/rpp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PurifyPlus</a> is a runtime analysis tool to detect <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/06/0822_satish-giridhar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">memory errors</a>, performance bottlenecks, and code coverage in C/C++ programs. It performs control and data flow analysis on program binaries and instruments them to call its runtime library for memory analysis and data collection.
</p>

<p>
I implemented support for 64-bit binaries in Purify and PureCoverage for AIX, redesigned Purify/AIX runtime for robust interception of libc functions and system calls, implemented new and dynamic mechanism for identifying system calls in Purify, contributed in designing a mechanism for Purify to work with un-instrumented shared libraries, and several other features. I was also PurifyPlus AIX tech lead for two years. These features were part of 7.0 and later releases.
