I love building software engineering and programming tools, and I have spent most of my working life doing just that. Here is a list of selected projects.

<h3 id="TOC-Mobile-Energy-Profiler"><a href="mobile-app-energy-profiler.html">Mobile App Energy Profiler for Windows Phone &amp; Windows 8</a> (Mobile Programming Tool)</h3>

<p>
Unlike desktops, mobile devices are plugged into power supply for only short 
durations, and a long lasting battery is a key desirable characteristic for 
device users. So, it is important for mobile applications to be energy 
efficient, and mobile application developers need to analyze the impact of 
their applications on the battery life. Just like execution time and memory 
profilers expose performance and memory bottlenecks respectively, an energy 
profiler exposes energy bottlenecks. It provides useful insights about power 
consumption by various hardware components (e.g. display, network, CPU), and 
helps application developers in identifying offending events, activities and 
segments of code that are causing high energy footprint, and improve energy 
efficiency of their applications.

<h3 id="TOC-UML-Action-Language"><a href="uml-action-language.html">UML Action Language in IBM Rational Software Architect</a> (Executable Model Programming Tool)</h3>

<p>
Rational Software Architect (RSA ) and its Real Time Edition (RSA-RTE) can 
transform behaviorally complete UML models into executable code. However, 
UML was not sufficient for defining complete behavior, and in practice, 
engineers embedded code snippets in a programming language (C++, Java) 
into the UML model. That causes portability and engineer productivity 
limitations. The project started with a one line description: <i>build 
a standard action language in RSA/RSA-RTE</i>. It gave me incredible 
opportunity to start from conceptualization phase, contribute in defining 
and standardizing 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UML Action Language</a>, 
define scenarios and capabilities, architect and design the system, and 
lead a small team to implement a robust tooling for UAL code editing, 
compilation &amp; translation, in RSA and model level simulation and 
debugging in RSA-RTA. It enhanced RSA as Model IDE for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Executable UML</a> 
to be on par with modern IDEs for various programming language.

<h3 id="TOC-PurifyPlus-AIX"><a href="purifyplus.html">Rational PurifyPlus for AIX/PowerPC</a> (C/C++ Programming Tool)</h3>

<p>
Rational 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/r/rpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PurifyPlus</a> 
is a runtime analysis tool to detect 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/06/0822_satish-giridhar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memory errors</a>, 
performance bottlenecks, and code coverage in C/C++ programs. 
It performs control and data flow analysis on program binaries and 
instruments them to call its runtime library for memory analysis and 
data collection. I implemented support for 64-bit binaries in Purify 
and PureCoverage for AIX, redesigned Purify/AIX runtime for robust 
interception of libc functions and system calls, implemented new and 
dynamic mechanism for identifying system calls in Purify, contributed 
in designing a mechanism for Purify to work with un-instrumented shared 
libraries, and several other features. I was also PurifyPlus AIX tech 
lead for about two years. Release in 7.0 and other releases.

<h3 id="TOC-Java-Leak-Analysis"><a href="leakbot-java-memory-leaks.html">Java Leak Analysis with Leakbot in Rational Application Developer</a> (Java Programming Tool)</h3>

<p>
Contrary to popular belief, 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/0816_GuptaPalanki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Java Memory Leaks</a> 
are possible, and are actually harder to isolate and rectify. 
I was tech lead for developing a data collection agent and leak analyzer 
based on <a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research.nsf/pages/r.plansoft.innovation2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakbot</a> technology. 
Released in <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/dec04/vohra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rational Application Developer 6.0</a> in June 2005.

<h3 id="TOC-Sarvega-XML-Switch">Sarvega XML Switch (XML/XPath/XSLT Processing Tool)</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sarvega.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sarvega</a> XML Switch 
(now <a href="http://www.intel.com/software/soae" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Intel SOA Expressway</a>) 
provides XML processing and information-aware routing infrastructure for 
deploying XML based Web services. It accelerates XML processing (XML parsing, 
validation and transformation), and provides intelligent content-based routing. 
During 2002-03, I worked in the core compiler group of 4 engineers responsible 
for XML parsing, schema validation, transformation, and optimization 
technologies. I worked on XML validator generator, XML tree slicing, resource 
cache state machine, and XPath based resource selection.

<h3 id="TOC-Software-Concordance"><a href="software-concordance.html">Software Concordance</a> (Software Development Life Cycle Tool)</h3>

<p>
The Software Concordance is a research prototype programming environment for 
experimenting with the benefits of enhanced hypermedia services for managing 
software documents, especially program source code. The Software Concordanceâ€™s 
central tool is a program source editor that allows developers to embed 
multimedia documentation and hyperlinks in their source code, while still 
supporting advanced program analysis services, including lexing, parsing, 
and type checking. The environment is designed to integrate all stages of 
software development life cycle. During 2000-01, I came up with the overall 
design of the system and developed the program source editor.
