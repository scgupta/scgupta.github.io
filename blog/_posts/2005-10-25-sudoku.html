Yes, I acknowledge that I am addicted to SuDoku. So much so that sometime back, I wrote a program in Java to solve SuDoku puzzles that come in the newspapers that I get. The program encodes very simple techniques in efficient way for finding whether only a single value is left that I cell can hold, or in a row/column/box, only a cell is left that can hold a particular value.

<p>After I was done, I googled to see what all is around related to SuDoku. And I was pretty happy that I was not the only crazy soul around. Here is some of the cool stuff:</p><ul><li>A company that sells SuDoku software: <a href="http://www.sudoku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sudoku.com</a></li><li>A <a href="http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Source-forge project for SuDoku</a></li><li>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SuDoku</a></li><li>Quite comprehensive details on <a href="http://www.paulspages.co.uk/sudoku/howtosolve/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to solve a SuDoku</a> </li><li>Other SuDoku solvers/generators from <a href="http://www.scanraid.com/Sudoku.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scanraid</a>, <a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/mark/sudoku/workpad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mark Huckvale</a>, <a href="http://www.menneske.no/sudoku/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Menneske</a></li></ul>The Wikipedia entry has quite interesting information, such as the general SuDoku problem is NP-Complete and can be expressed as a graph coloring problem.</p>

<p>You may ask why I am writing about all this today, though I had written my SuDoku solver quite sometime back. The reason is: the SuDoku that was in this Sunday’s (Oct 23, 2005) <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hindu</a> newspaper. My ego was hurt because my program couldn’t solve a SuDoku that I could. So I updated the program, built in some more logic, so that it could solve that one. Two tricks are still missing from my program: n-tuple (pair/triplet etc), and patterns (X Wing, Swordfish).</p>

<p>Ah, some day I will write an applet with a nice GUI for my SuDoku program and put it on the web!</p>
