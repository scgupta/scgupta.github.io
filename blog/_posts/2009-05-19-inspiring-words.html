<p>I visited <a href="http://bigb.bigadda.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amitabh Bachchan's blog</a> to read <a href="http://bigb.bigadda.com/?p=2567" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his tribute to Prakash Mehra</a>, who passed away on May 17, 2009. Prakash gave Amitabh his first superhit role the Zanjeer and then casted him in a series of incredibly successful movies for next 15 year. What Amitabh wrote about Prakash was touching.</p>

<p>I also came across this inspiring quote on <a href="http://bigb.bigadda.com/?p=2573" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his next blog entry</a> by <a href="" target="_blank" rel-"nofollow">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in 1910 at the Sorbonne in Paris:</p>

<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory or defeat.</blockquote>

<p>It made my day.</p>
