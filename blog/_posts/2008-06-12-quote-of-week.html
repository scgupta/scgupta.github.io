I saw multiple examples this week which reminded me of this famous quote by <a href="http://www.generalpatton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">George Smith Patton, Jr.</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.</blockquote>

<p>While a young bright intern surprised me with a cool solution to a complex problem, in a separate incident, I also saw the kind of damage it can cause to the morale of the "troops" if you tell them what to do, how to do, and when to do, and their role is limited to just doing it.</p>
